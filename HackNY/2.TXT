Where'd you grow up?

"I grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah. I was raised Mormon and was one of 6 children. I had a wonderful *smiles* childhood. Tons of mischief, like burning Christmas trees in a fire. We also put a porcupine in a girls van one time."

Do you remember a transformative moment in your childhood?

"I lost a lot of my religious beliefs around 7 years ago. I went to China for 3 months when I was 19 years old. I was alone the whole time and traveled over 4000 miles. I actually snuck into Tibet and they kicked me out. I went from being in a small city to country of a billion people. Completely different."

Where do you see yourself in 4 years?

In a mirror. *laughs*

If you could give one piece of advice to yourself 4 years ago, what would it be?

"4 years ago I was 23 and working on my startup. I'm 27 now. I would tell myself to move to New York City. I would say: Do the things that will get me to the place I am now, faster."
