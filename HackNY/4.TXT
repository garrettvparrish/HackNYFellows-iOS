MIT, works at Oyster Books in Chelsea

Where'd you grow up?

'I grew up somewhere between Philadelphia, China, and New Jersey. I don't remember most of my life in China because I was young. You know how they say when you hear a story 3 times, you end up believing it's true? They told me I was reciting Lao Tzu at 2 years old. But anyways, I ended up living with my loving grandparents, getting my cheeks squeezed a lot.'

What is your biggest struggle right now?

'I feel pressure to figure out what I want to be.

In a perfect world I would have been a teacher. However, I have moral dilemmas with becoming a teacher. I don't want to adhere to specific policies of an institution. I think teachers these days say "this is the way you should think."

I think one of the purest things in the world is passing on knowledge. When you walk into the library, there's a lot of crap. So, how can you filter out the good stuff?'

Where do you see yourself in 4 years?

'I'm not sure. If my 20s aren't the most productive years of my life, I'm okay with that. Van Gogh made some of his best work in the last few years of his life. We'll find out.

Why make something mediocre under pressure? For me, my life is better spent taking time to do something non-mediocre.'

If you could give one piece of advice to yourself 4 years ago, what would it be?

Take time to explore. My life has a lot of what ifs. What if I went to Law School? Maybe it's like Broccoli.'
