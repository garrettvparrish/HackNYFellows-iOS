Goes to University of Chicago, works at Oscar Health in SoHo

Where did you grow up?

'Howell, NJ. It's a small town in central Jersey. We lived in Howell almost my whole life. We moved once about a block away. I have one sister who is older than me, and when I was 10 we adopted two kids from Ukraine. I was homeschooled for 5 years, so I was in a really sheltered environment. I transitioned to going to public school which was very traumatic. We all know how welcoming elementary school kids are. 

I was ahead academically when I transferred. When I was homeschooled, I didn't have video games or anything, so I read a lot of books. My older sister was a huge influence. I didn't get into Computer Science until later. I taught myself Python in high school, but didn't start taking CS until my second year of college.'

What's your biggest struggle?

'I would call it 'self-confidence.' I need to convince myself that i'm well suited to the task at hand. I tend to fail to internalize my own accomplishments. It's basically the imposter syndrome. Usually I do just fine, but it's still something that I get anxious about.'

What advice would you give the person you were 4 years ago?

I was probably sleeping this moment 4 years ago, haha. I was a lot more uptight about grades. I was your stereotypical 'oh my god, I have to be valedictorian and get good grades.' I guess I wanted to get into a good college. I've always been a huge perfectionist. 

I would tell them to stop worrying so much. I've stopped worrying about my grades. Because in the end, everything will be all right.'

Where do you see yourself going in 4 years?

I still have 2 years left of college so I don't know if I should get a job in tech or go to grad school. As clich'e9 as this sounds, my biggest goal is just to wake up every morning and love what I do. That's where I want to be.
