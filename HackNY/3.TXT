Dartmouth College, works at Kickstarter in Brooklyn

Where'd you grow up?

'I grew up in Boston and moved every 5 years. I kind of moved from apartment to apartment. It was hard growing up. The rest of my family was born in China, and I was the first born in America. By the time high school rolled around, I found a program that helped me get into a better middle school. Eventually, I picked up rowing and went to Dartmouth to row. Eventually I got injured. By chance, I stumbled into CS around 2 years ago. My life has turned a lot of chapters.

What motivates you right now?

If I don't like something, I won't do it. I do what I want to do. My parent's had a lot of struggles, so I want to be something, for them. Family is really important to me. I went back to China by myself for 4 months to visit the other side of my family. In terms of motivation, I won't try hard to succeed, but I will work hard to find happiness."

Where do you see yourself in 4 years?

"Four years ago, I was very structured. Now, I'm not consistent at all. I don't order the same smoothie twice. I don't eat the same cereal twice. I don't plan for the future really."

If you could give one piece of advice to yourself 4 years ago, what would it be?

"Being a competitive rower, I became accustomed to being afraid of time. I'd tell myself that you don't always need to give someone an explanation for why you do something. I know it's cliche, but be yourself, and try not to be influenced by what others want you to be. I try to live without regrets. I don't know where i'm going but I know how to get there. And that is a weird feeling."
