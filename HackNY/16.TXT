Where'd you grow up?

"I was born in India but my family moved to California when I was a baby. Pretty much grew up in the suburbs of Sacramento. I have a younger sister, my dad's a hardware engineer and my mom did some software stuff in a past life before becoming a full time mom. My family is full of engineers and doctors. I have a lot to look up and live up to!

My dad would teach me stuff sometimes, like taking apart a computer. From an early age I knew I wanted to do something with computers.

I was pretty lucky because I joined a robotics team in middle school. I continued it throughout high school and that pushed me into engineering.'

Have you had any revelations in the past few years?

'I realized the world is never going to be perfect. But I can still make an impact. I figured out that I do have the capability to change the world for the better, I think everyone does. Some people just act upon it more than others.'

What's your biggest struggle?

'I'm always battling time. There are so many things I want to do and experience but I feel like I never have enough time. But sometimes I'm doing too many things, and I lose sight of what truly matters.'

What advice would you give the person you were 4 years ago?

'Four years ago I was in high school and I was incredibly shy. I was so afraid of talking to people. The advice I would give myself is be confident. Don't let your insecurities define who you are or who you think you can be. You think people are noticing things about you, but really, they are too wrapped up in themselves.'

Where do you see yourself 4 years from now?
'There's so much potential to use technology in a high impact, meaningful way. I feel like some startups are too focused on making incremental changes to the lives of people who already have a nice life. I want to use technology to save and really improve lives. I'm still figuring out how to do that.'
