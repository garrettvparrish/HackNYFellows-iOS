Goes to University Of Michigan works at REDI 

Redi is startup spun out of Goldman Sachs in the Financial District

Where'd you grow up?

"Born in India and moved eventually to Michgan. My parents were engineers so they were always teaching me different things. I had access to a lot of books and was an encouraged to go into math early on. At the same time, I picked up music and singing. By the time high school ended, I knew I wanted to go into some form of engineering."

Do you remember a transformative moment in your past?

"As part of my university, everyone in engineering takes a computer science class. I had never done programming until college. After my first class, I fell in love with it. 

I took a codecademy class and that helped a ton. 

But the realizations came when I attended a college hackathon called PennApps at UPenn. I had the worst time there. Everyone said "go to hackathons and you'll learn everything." I went and I had no idea what I was doing. Everyone around me didn't really help that much. My team was just "there." After that, I saw the huge reward of getting into computer science, so I dedicated myself to learning it."

What's your biggest struggle right now?

"Not enough time."

What advice would you give the person you were 4 years ago?

"Be completely open to doing new things."

Where do you see yourself going in 4 years?

"I see myself going to grad school for a little while. I'll probably look to join a large startup or a company and learn as much as I can there. Then, I'd like to do my own thing."
