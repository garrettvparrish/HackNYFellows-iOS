HackNYFellows
=============

Hello everyone, 


<img style=“width:800px;” src=“https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garrettvparrish/HackNYFellows-iOS/master/banner.png”</img>

This app is the repository for the HackNY Fellows app. This product allows past, present and future fellows to connect. It also exists to educate anyone about the members of the HackNY fellows, where they worked, and who they are. 

In order to populate this product and keep it sustainable overtime, 2014 Fellows Garrett Parrish and Kyle Ryan created (insert website here) to allow past and future fellows to contribute content to the app. 

Background:
The HackNY Fellows Program was founded by Chris Wiggins and Evan Korth in 2011 to federate the next generation of hackers for the New York City Tech Community. 

Every year, HackNY picks 30 of the best applicants from around the country to have technical internships with companies in New York City.
